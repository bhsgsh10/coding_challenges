# Directions for solving different type of problems on arrays

## 1. Use a hashmap when
finding a pair/group of numbers satisfying a given target condition

## 2. Use Two pointers when
* searching a set of elements with a given condition
* finding triplets or a subarray with a given condition

## 3. Fast and slow pointer when
* find the position of an element or the length of the array, where the array is cyclic or has a loop

## 4. Two heaps when
* find the largest/smallest/median of elements of an array

## 5. Subset when
* permutation and combination of the given set

## 6. Top K elements when
* find the top K smallest/largest/frequent elements of an array

## 7. Sliding window when
* find the longest/shortest subset of the given array

## 8. Merge intervals when
* find overlapping intervals/mutually exclusive intervals/merge intervals given the input is an array of intervals

## 9. Dynamic programming when nothing else applies


# Directions for solving different type of problems on linked lists

## 1. Traverse + optional collection
when traversing the linked list from start to end, while validating and finding something, eg; adding two numbers represented by linked lists

## 2. Two pointers 
Is applicable when you have to 
* perform an operation, given Nth node from the end of the list
+ list is cyclic
* given two merged lists

## 3. Link manipulation
when we have to 
- modify the given linked list in place
- perform an operation on two linked lists. eg; merge two sorted lists to give one sorted list

## 4. Recursion
- perform the same operation till a base case has been reached

## 5. In-way merge
- given multiple sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted list
